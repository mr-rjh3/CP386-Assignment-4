# Contiguous Memory Allocation Simulation (CP386 A4 Spring 2022)

### Developers:
Riley Huston & Christine Nguyen

### Features:
This program simulates contiguous memory allocation algorithms such as best fit, worst fit and first fit. It also contains auxiliary functions which displays current allocated processes in memory and where holes are located, as well as the ability to "compact" our processes to avoid external fragmentation.  Our functions are as follows: 

### Development Log:
The first thing we did is read over the assignment documentation and extract required information such as the commands and what functions seemed to be necessary. From there we mapped out the functions in further detail and assigned work. Riley is to code the allocation and de-allocation and I, Christine, am to write the README.md, as well as code the status and compact features. Riley went on to create a template for the code for the both of us to complete by writing the names of the functions with a brief description of what it is expected to accomplish.

### How to Use:
The program continues to take keyboard input until the user enters "Exit" as the string. Otherwise, the user can enter several commands such as RQ, RL, Status and C.
